He received a B.S. in theoretical nuclear physics for university of Turin, Italy and a M.S. and Ph.D. in theoretical high energy physics from the University of Connecticut. He joined the SDMC group in December 2004 at first as National Research Council post doctoral fellow and later as NASA post doctoral fellow conducting research on optical properties and spin manipulation of Silicon quantum dots and fault tolerant high performance computing in space. He became a permanent member of the SDMC in December 2006. Since joining JPL he covered a vast range of fields spanning from physics, framework development for scientific applications, atmospheric radar algorithm, to machine learning for earth science. His main focus in the past few years at JPL have been cloud-based Science Data Systems and machine learning. In 2017 he became a co-founder of Praesidium Inc. where he currently is working on applying machine learning techniques and digital signal processing algorithm to our products. Since late 2019 Giangi moved to a part-time position at JPL to dedicate more time to Praesidium and combine his love for science and the opportunity to apply technology to improve the quality of life of many people which is the company mission. In his (very limited) spare time he enjoys mountain biking, hiking, practicing martial arts, yoga and fitness in general. He is also an amateur (and untalented) flamenco and classical guitar player.","categories":["Management","Engineer","Founder"]},{"name":"Paolo Focardi","titleRank":5,"title":"RF Engineer","img":"img/team/Paolo_Focardi_600x600.webp","accomplishments":["PhD in Computer Science from University of Florence","Senior RF Microwave Engineer at NASA JPL","Over 20 years experience in Electromagnetic’s","Leading hardware & software R&D on remote sensing of vital signs since 2004"],"bio":"I developed and delivered the Feed Horn Assembly for SMAP, the first scientific flight project to use a deployable mesh reflector and was responsible for radiation pattern calculations including the effect of the entire spacecraft. I have been responsible for the development of the RF front end needed for the \"Remote Sensing of Human Vital Signs\" project. Several planar antennas and directional couplers have been designed, fabricated and tested. I supervised the measurement of radiation pattern and scattering parameters of the antennas under development. I also collaborated with Tanner Labs at the development of THz detectors for a two year project funded by the Air Force entitled \"Multispectral Imaging with a Plasmon Lens\". I have been supporting the development of the A1 and A2 antennas for JUNO. After that I joined the RF team developing the reflector antenna for SMAP. I am also the JPL PI of a project entitled \"A room temperature Tunable Antenna Coupled Intersubband Terahertz (TACIT) detector for man portable spectroscopy instruments\" in collaboration with Tanner Labs and UCSB.","categories":["Management","Board","Founder"]},{"name":"Tyler Daniels","titleRank":6,"title":"Founder","img":"img/team/Tyler_Daniels_600x600.webp","accomplishments":["4 Years USAF","7 Years Real Estate Appraiser","17 Years Owner Retirement Options Inc","Original Praesidium Investor Group"],"bio":"Has organized a sales/distribution network currently supporting in excess of $10M/mo - $100M/yr with total global sales in excess of $1B.

In his free time, he studies nanotechnology, particle physics, and thinkers with his GUT (Grand Unification Theory – no pun intended). His Philosophy (and I quote): “I consider every day an opportunity to learn something new. Since we can't learn what we think we already know, it is vital to systematically separate the known from the unknown. While this is obvious to most, it is easier said than done. Many factors can cause one to lose sight which is why I think it is vital to work on our ability to remain focused on facts.” ","categories":["Engineer"]},{"name":"Chad Koslovsky","titleRank":7,"title":"Fullstack Engineer","img":"img/team/Chad_Koslovsky.webp","imgAlt":"img/team/Chad_Koslovsky_600x600.webp","social":{"github":"https://github.com/Ravonus","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadkoslovsky/"},"accomplishments":["built this website.","is part robot.","found the Matrix."],"bio":"He is a robot.
